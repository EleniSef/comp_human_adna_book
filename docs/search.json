    "text": "3 Introduction\nF-Statistics are one of the simplest summary-statistics of genotype data that help us gain insights into the relationships of individuals and groups.\nSome key references up front:\nOutgroup-F3-Statistics are perhaps one of the easiest to understand, so we’ll start with them. F3-Statistics in general are defined as:\n\\[F_3(A, B;C) = \\langle(c-a)(c-b)\\rangle\\]\nwhich looks a bit unintuitive. Here, \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are populations or individuals to be compared, and \\(C\\) denotes an outgroup, and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are the non-reference allele frequencies of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), respectively. The expression \\(\\langle\\cdot\\rangle\\) denotes an average over all SNPs in the dataset.\nWe can understand it best as a measure of genetic similarity between groups A and B, evaluated on SNPs where A and B carry a different allele than the outgroup C. Here is an example based on A, B and C all consisting of just a single haploid sample each:\nEvery SNP where A and B have the same allele, which in turn is different from the outgroup C contributes 1 to the statistic, all other positions contribute 0. So the higher this number, the more similar A and B are, and the more distant is the outgroup C from both A and B."

    "text": "4.1 Linearity in A and B (but not C)\nWhat happens if \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are populations, instead of single samples? Conveniently, this statistic is linear in A and B, which means that the resulting statistic will just be an average over all combinations of individuals in A and B. The same is true for diploid samples A and B, in which case the result will just be the average similarity between all haplotypes between A and B. In mathematical terms:\n\\[F_3(\\{A_1,A_2\\},B;C) = \\frac{1}{2}(F_3(A_1,B;C)+F_3(A_2,B;C))\\]\n(and similarly for $B={B_1,B_2}).\nNote that F_3 statistics are not linear in \\(C\\). This has rarely any consequences, because we typically use some fixed group for \\(C\\) (see below0), and only vary \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) in our analyses. But it is useful for the interpration to know that at least for A and B, group-based statistics are simply averages over individual-based ones."
