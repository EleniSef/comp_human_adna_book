In the last few thousand years of their documented existence, they met and interbred with modern humans who arrived from Africa, and as a result, 2-3% of the ancestry of present-day non-Africans derives from Neandertals and between 0.2 to 4% from Denisovans ([@green_draft_2010],[@reich_genetic_2010],[@meyer_high-coverage_2012],[@prüfer2017], [@hajdinjak2021]).\n\nGenome-wide average archaic ancestry can be detected using F-statistics or D-statistics ([@Peter_admixture_2016]). However, for more detailed investigation of the archaic ancestry in the modern human genomes, segment calling is preferred.\n\n#### What can we learn from the segments?\n\n-   Number and duration of the introgression event(s)\n\n-   Generations past since the introgression event\n\n-   If the archaic segments in different individuals result from the same introgression event or not [@iasi2024]\n\n-   Selection, functional consequences..\n\nHidden Markov Models (HMMs) are used for calling the archaic segments, and there are various methods including hmmix which is reference free method that currently do not work on low coverage data [@skov2018], and other HMMs which can detect segments using genotype calls (again, not suitable for low coverage data) [@prüfer2021]. In this chapter, we will focus on admixfrog [@peter2020], as it can call segments in low and contaminated data.\n\n## Calling archaic segments with admixfrog\n\nAdmixfrog can call segments of archaic ancestry from unphased nuclear genomes with coverage as low as 0.2x, both from shotgun and capture data. It is well tested on not only detecting Neandertal/Denisovan ancestry in modern human genomes, but also for detecting Denisovan ancestry in Neandertal genomes. Admixfrog is a HMM with hidden states being all possible pairwise combinations of ancestry between user defined source populations. The method does not rely on simulations and model assumptions much, and uses the data to estimate parameters with a flexible Bayes model. It requires two main input files:\n\n1.  Target genome that belongs to the individual one wants to detect archaic ancestry in. This file can be created from a bam file using the command **admixfrog-bam**. Alternatively, if contamination and error should not be estimated, it is possible to use genotypes provided in eigenstrat-format. It contains observed number of alternative and reference reads, and is stratified by read length, library ID, and presence/absence of deamination on the read.\n\n2.  Reference file that includes the high coverage genomes of the \"sources\" admixfrog uses to model the ancestries in the target genome. This file can be created from vcf files using the command **admixfrog-ref**. Reference file is very important and should be generated carefully. If capture data is being used for the \"target\", reference file should also be ascertained with the same capture sites. The assumption of admixfrog is that the source genomes are unadmixed. It contains the counts of alternative and reference alleles for all reference populations, and specifies the genetic map that is used.\n\nWhen these two input files are provided and various parameters (such as bin size, states, recombination map, run penalty, error rate..) are specified, admixfrog splits the target genome into bins of a given size and estimates the probability of (homozygous or heterozygous) reference ancestry (combination) for each bin. It does that from the genotypes in the bin by estimating the probability of observing the target genotypes given a reference population. If genotypes are not available, admixfrog can estimate the genotype likelihood from the read date, while taking contamination into account. For this, it uses a genotype likelihood model :\n\n$P(O_r|G, c_r, n_r, e_r, p^c) ~ Binom(O_r; n_r, p)$\n\nwhere $p = (1-e_r)p'+e_r(1-p')$ and $p'=c_rp_c + (1-c_r)G$.\n\n![Figure 1: Admixfrog segment calling and genotype likelihood models.](img/admixfrog/figure1.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\nThe contamination is estimated from the observed allele on the reads ($O_r$). The reads are clustered into read groups ($r$ with $n_r$ reads in the read group) which stem from a certain sequence library, with a given length and presence or absence of contamination. From this the proportion of contamination ($c_r$) and error ($e_r$) is estimated. The basic idea here is that if there is no contamination $,p$ the probability of seeing a derived allele, should be the same across all read groups for a certain SNP. If there is, however, contamination and error it will lead to variation between read groups from, which the error and contamination parameter can be estimated.\n\n#### Installing admixfrog\n\nAdmixfrog requires python version 3.8 or higher, along with several packages. Dependencies can be installed with `pip install cython scipy --upgrade` and admixfrog can be installed from github with `pip install git+https://github.com/benjaminpeter/admixfrog`.\n\nMore information can be found in the github page, [installation explained in: https://github.com/BenjaminPeter/admixfrog/tree/master](#0).\n\n#### Preparing input files\n\n-   Target file\n\nIf you have called trustworthy genotypes for your target sample, you can use the VCF and create the input file:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.bash .cell-code}\nadmixfrog-bam --ref ref_example.xz --vcfgt {input.vcf} --target {sample_name}\"\n  --force-target-file \n  --out {output.csv} \n```\n:::\n\n\nIf bam file is being used, make sure the RG tag in the bam file is specifying the correct library the read came from (quite often not the case). Also if library is fully UDG treated it might me difficult to determine deaminations:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.bash .cell-code}\nadmixfrog-bam --bam ${target}.bam --ref ref_example.xz --out ${target}.in.xz\n```\n:::\n\n\nThis file should looks something like this:\n\n```\nchrom  pos        lib                         tref  talt  tdeam  tother\n1      847983     Lib.L.9150_0_nodeam         1     0     0      0\n1      851309     Lib.L.9150_1_nodeam         1     0     0      0\n1      853596     Lib.K.4356_1_nodeam         1     0     0      0\n1      853962     Lib.K.4356_2_nodeam         1     0     0      0\n1      858641     Lib.L.9150_0_deam           1     0     0      0\n1      859871     Lib.L.9150_0_deam           1     0     0      0\n1      867151     Lib.L.9150_0_nodeam         1     0     0      0\n1      867404     Lib.L.9150_4_deam           1     0     0      0\n1      872687     Lib.K.4356_0_nodeam         1     0     0      0\n1      873541     Lib.K.4356_2_deam           1     0     0      0\n...\n```\n\n-   Reference file\n\nThis file contains the population allele counts for the reference and alternative allele, for the reference populations the target genome is 'painted' with. This requires high quality genomes for accurate allele frequencies, especially if the number of individuals per reference is very small or even just a single individual. The closer the reference population is to the introgression population the better. If reference populations are themselves admixed (with one of the other reference populations), as many individuals as possible should be provided for a good inference. Usually only ancestry informative sites are used (sites where the are substantial frequency differences between reference populations or even differentially fixed sites). This also increases the speed of admixfrog.\n\nFor each site, the reference file contains the chromosome, physical position and at least one genetic map giving the genetic distance between sites. Using the command presented here the reference file is constructed from a single vcf file containing all reference individuals. The individuals are specified in a .yaml file with their names being the same as in the vcf file, like this:\n\n```\nAFR:\n    - S_Yoruba-1.DG\n    - S_Yoruba-2.DG\n    - B_Yoruba-3.DG\n    - S_Yoruba-1.DG\nNEA:\n    - Altai_snpAD.DG\n    - Vindija_snpAD.DG\nDEN:\n    - Denisova_snpAD.DG\n```\n\nthe rec file specifies the genetic map to be used in the form of the AA Map, with tab separated columns being: Physical_Pos and Name of genetic map (column has the genetic distances in cM).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.bash .cell-code}\nadmixfrog-ref --vcf x_{CHROM}.vcf.gz --out x.ref.xz  \\\n    --states AFR VIN=Vindija33.19 DEN=Denisova \\\n    --pop-file data.yaml \\\n    --rec-file rec.{CHROM}\n```\n:::\n\n\nThis file should look something like this:\n\n```\nchrom  pos        ref  alt  map        AA_Map     deCODE     YRI_LD     CEU_LD     AFK_ref  AFK_alt  AFR_ref  AFR_alt  ALT_ref  ALT_alt  ARC_ref  ARC_alt  CHA_ref  CHA_alt  D11_ref  D11_alt  DEN_ref  DEN_alt  EAS_ref  EAS_alt  EUR_ref  EUR_alt \n1      812425     G    A    0.00000    0.00000    0.00000    0.30581    0.16677    414      0        80       0        1        1        7        1        2        0        1        0        2        0        94       0        148      0       \n1      812751     T    C    0.00000    0.00000    0.00000    0.30810    0.16771    116      298      0        0        2        0        6        2        2        0        1        0        0        2        0        0        0        0       \n1      813034     A    G    0.00000    0.00000    0.00000    0.31009    0.16853    383      31       0        0        0        2        3        5        0        2        0        1        2        0        0        0        0        0       \n1      834198     T    C    0.00000    0.00000    0.00000    0.45887    0.22962    394      20       73       3        0        2        2        6        0        2        0        1        2        0        73       13       123      21      \n1      834360     C    T    0.00000    0.00000    0.00000    0.46001    0.23009    414      0        80       0        1        1        4        4        0        2        0        1        2        0        94       0        148      0       \n1      837238     G    A    0.00000    0.00000    0.00000    0.48024    0.23840    414      0        72       0        2        0        6        2        2        0        0        0        0        2        88       0        124      0       \n1      845938     G    A    0.00000    0.00000    0.00000    0.54139    0.26349    178      236      41       27       2        0        6        2        2        0        0        0        0        2        61       19       98       24      \n1      846687     C    T    0.00000    0.00000    0.00000    0.54665    0.26565    402      12       66       2        2        0        8        0        2        0        1        0        2        0        78       0        138      0       \n1      847041     C    T    0.00000    0.00000    0.00000    0.54790    0.26625    391      23       64       4        2        0        6        2        2        0        0        0        0        2        72       0        118      0       \n1      847491     G    A    0.00000    0.00000    0.00000    0.54790    0.26638    260      154      50       26       2        0        6        2        2        0        1        0        0        2        80       8        107      27      \n...\n```\n\n#### Running admixfrog\n\nMost of the time the default parameter should work fine. Make sure to specify all reference populations you want to use in the **--states** parameter. The reference population from which you think the contamination stems from is specified with the --cont-id parameter (usually a modern human population, can also be one of the states e.g. AFR). The **--ancestral** parameter specify the reference population used to polarize the alleles. If not specified the ancestral states are unknown. With the **--filter-ancestral** you can filter all alleles where that do not have any ancestral information.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.bash .cell-code}\nadmixfrog --infile ${target}.in.xz --ref ref_ascertainment.csv.xz -o ${target_output} \\\n--states AFR NEA DEN --cont-id EUR --ll-tol 1e-2 --bin-size 5000 \\\n--est-F --est-tau --freq-F 1 --freq-contamination 3 --e0 1e-2 --est-error \\\n--ancestral PAN --run-penalty 0.1 --max-iter 250 --n-post-replicates 200 \\\n--filter-pos 50 --filter-map 0.000 --init-guess AFR --map-column AA_Map\n```\n:::\n\n\nAdmixfrog has many optional parameters that are not used in the command above, and most up to date parameter descriptions can be accessed with the command:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.bash .cell-code}\nadmixfrog --help\n```\n:::\n\n\nNames provided for the reference genomes after the **--states** should be specified as they are in the reference input file. It is possible to provide only two, in case Denisovan ancestry is not expected or relevant. Ancestral state needs to specified also with **--ancestral**, and this is always the chimpanzee genome (PAN).\n\nIn the above example, we are trying to detect archaic ancestry in a modern human genome. That is why **--init-guess** is set to AFR. If we were trying to detect modern human ancestry in the genome of a Neandertal, **--init-guess** should have been set to NEA. Population name specified after **--cont-id** stands for the most likely source for the present-day human contamination in the sample, and also should be named as it is specified in the reference file. Optional parameter **--ll-tol** stops EM when Delta log likelihood is less than ll-tol specified. Bin size is controlled by the value provided after **--bin-size**. By default, this is given as 1e-8 cM, so that the unit is approximately the same for runs on physical / map positions.\n\nAdmixfrog can estimate several parameters if wanted. These are\n\n-   F:  Distance from reference (estimated if **--est-F** given). A related parameter is **--freq-F** that specifies the frequency of updating the estimate of F (e.g. in how many iterations it should be updated).\n\n-   tau: population structure in references and is estimated if **--est-tau** is included. Initial value of tau is 0 by default.\n\n-   error: Sequencing error can be estimated per read group, if **--est-error** is a parameter. Value given after **--e0** parameter determines the initial error rate.\n\nValue provided after the parameter **--max-iter** specifies the maximum number of iterations. **--n-post-replicates** is important for the estimation of parameters listed above, and controls the number of replicates that will be sampled from the posterior. The distance between the positions is controlled by –**filter-pos.** Value provided after this parameter is the number of bases there should be between the positions. Value of **--filter-map** determines the distance between the positions based on the recombination map provided. Recombination map preferred should be specified with **--map-column**. Name of the recombination map given after should match the column name in the reference file.\n\nRun penalty value provided after **--run-penalty** determines how likely nearby segments are joined or broken up. If 0.1, next bin should have at least \\> 0.9 posterior probability to continue an archaic segment. 0.25 expects at least \\> 0.75 posterior probability etc.\n\n![Figure 2: Run penalty example.](img/admixfrog/figure2.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n#### Output files\n\nThere are 6 output files admixfrog can (and will) produce and they are all compressed with LZMA. They can be looked at with\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.bash .cell-code}\nxzless ${output}.xz | column -s, -t | less -S\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe present the 10 top rows of each output file as an example below. Input files provided for this run were resritced and ascertained with the sites on the \"Archaic admixture array\" [@fu2015], as we use this capture array to obtain data from the sites best represent the diversity in the archaic genomes.\n\n-   **\\${output}.cont.xz** : contamination estimates for each read group (library and deamination status) but only if the bam file is provided as the input. This output file contains the contamination estimates per read group, along with the error proportion and the number of reads in the read group. The overall contamination proportion estimate can be computed by taking the weighted average of the contamination proportion per read group weighted by the number of reads in that group.\n\n```\nrg                          cont      error     lib                len_bin  deam    n_reads  tot_n_snps\nLib.L.9150_0_nodeam         0.006364  0.011476  Lib.L.9150         0        nodeam  140015   1333880\nLib.K.4356_2_nodeam         0.060802  0.015108  Lib.K.4356         2        nodeam  195136   1333880\nLib.L.9150_1_nodeam         0.033591  0.014670  Lib.L.9150         1        nodeam  118054   1333880\nLib.K.4356_0_deam           0.016506  0.021292  Lib.K.4356         0        deam    117600   1333880\nLib.L.9150_0_deam           0.045305  0.020753  Lib.L.9150         0        deam    78027    1333880\nLib.L.9150_3_nodeam         0.070068  0.013863  Lib.L.9150         3        nodeam  20157    1333880\nLib.K.4356_2_deam           0.044722  0.020644  Lib.K.4356         2        deam    87877    1333880\nLib.K.4356_0_nodeam         0.001356  0.010723  Lib.K.4356         0        nodeam  200039   1333880\nLib.L.9150_1_deam           0.049495  0.021663  Lib.L.9150         1        deam    65808    1333880\nLib.L.9150_2_nodeam         0.014923  0.017070  Lib.L.9150         2        nodeam  53843    1333880\n```\n\n-   **\\${output}.bin.xz** : posterior decoding for each bin along the genome.

Incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) might be incorrectly detected as an introgressed segment. In most publications only segments with a minimum length of 0.2 cM are retained for very ancient individuals (such as early modern humans) and 0.05 cM for more recent ancient and present day humans.\n\nOverall Neandertal ancestry can be calculated from the \\${output}.res.xz file after filtering this file for ILS as following:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nres=read.csv(\"output.res.xz\")\nres_len_it = res %>% filter(state=='NEA', len>=40) \n# len 10 for 0.05 cM and 40 for 0.2 cM\n\n# filtering out the ILS in the called Neandertal segments\nres_Nead_sumlen = res_len_it %>% group_by(it) %>% mutate(sum_len_NEA=sum(len)) \nres_Nead_sumlen = res_Nead_sumlen %>% summarize(it, sum_len_NEA) %>% filter(row_number()==1)\n\n# filtering out the ILS in all called segments\nres_all_sumlen = res %>% filter(len>=40) %>% group_by(it) %>% mutate(sum_len_ALL=sum(len))\nres_all_sumlen = res_all_sumlen %>% summarize(it, sum_len_ALL) %>% filter(row_number()==1)\n\n# calculating the ratio of Neandertal vs. all segments, per iteration\n\nres_cat = left_join(res_Nead_sumlen, res_all_sumlen) %>%\n  mutate(nea_all_ratio = sum_len_NEA/sum_len_ALL, specimen = \"Specimen_name\") \n\n# maximum and minimum estimates from all iterations: \nmax(res_cat$nea_all_ratio) # 0.0312594\nmin(res_cat$nea_all_ratio) # 0.02978274\nmean(res_cat$nea_all_ratio) # 0.0303691\n```\n:::\n\n\n#### Limitations of admixfrog\n\n-   Short segments might not be called or called with high false positive rate.\n\n-   Run penalty, which determines how often the segments are broken down, needs to be provided by the used. A run penalty that is too conservative (0.1) could break the real segments while a run penalty that is not conservative enough (0.4) could merge separate segments together. The best penalty to use depends on the age of the target genome, and the expected length of the segments. Best practice currently is running admixfrog with different run penalties and comparing the results. Alternative ways of merging/breaking segments is currently being developed.\n\n-   For the genomes of relatively recent individuals, segment calling results depend a lot on the recombination map used. For older specimens (e.g. early modern humans) the effect of recombination map is small. Best practice currently is running admixfrog with different recombination maps and comparing the results.\n\n-   Better assignment for deeply divergent references, drop in performance when the references are not deeply diverged. Can result in possible missasignment of ancestries as seen sometimes with Denisovan segments are being called as Neandertal in present day populations.\n\n-   Better assignment when reference and actual source population are close. For example, the Denisovan populations that introgressed into modern humans are not well represented by the Denisova3 high-coverage genome that is used as the reference representing the Denisovans. This makes the detection of the Denisovan segments challenging.\n",
