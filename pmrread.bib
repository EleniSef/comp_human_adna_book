              lcMLkin, NgsRelate, KIN, and READ, which differ in their input,
              IBD-estimation methods and statistical approaches. We used
              pedigree and ancient genome sequence simulations to evaluate
              these tools when only a limited number (1K to 50K) of shared SNPs
              (with minor allele frequency $\geq$0.01) are available. The
              performance of all four tools was comparable using $\geq$20K
              SNPs. We found that first-degree related pairs can be accurately
              classified even with 1K SNPs, with 85\% F1 scores using READ and
              96\% using NgsRelate or lcMLkin. Distinguishing third-degree
              relatives from unrelated pairs or second-degree relatives was
              also possible with high accuracy (F1 >90\%) with 5K SNPs using
              NgsRelate and lcMLkin, while READ and KIN showed lower success
              (69\% and 79\%, respectively). Meanwhile, noise in population
              allele frequencies and inbreeding (first cousin mating) led to
              deviations in kinship coefficients, with different sensitivities

              re-implementation of the most widely used tool for this purpose.
              While providing increased portability and making the software
              future-proof, we are also able to show that READv2 (a) is orders
              of magnitude faster than its predecessor; (b) has increased power
              to detect pairs of relatives using optimized default parameters;
              and, when the number of overlapping SNPs is sufficient, (c) can

              increasingly important role in the ancient DNA field. In recent
              years, the numbers of sequenced individuals from single sites
              have been increasing, reflecting a growing interest in
              understanding the familial and social organisation of ancient
              populations. Although a few different methods have been
              specifically developed for ancient DNA, namely to tackle issues
              such as low-coverage homozygous data, they require a
              0.1-1$\times$ minimum average genomic coverage per analysed pair
              of individuals. Here we present an updated version of a method
              that enables estimates of 1st and 2nd-degrees of relatedness with
              as little as 0.026$\times$ average coverage, or around 18,000
              SNPs from 1.3 million aligned reads per sample with average
              length of 62 bp-four times less data than 0.1$\times$ coverage at
              similar read lengths. By using simulated data to estimate false
              positive error rates, we further show that a threshold even as
              low as 0.012$\times$, or around 4000 SNPs from 600,000 reads,
              will always show 1st-degree relationships as related. Lastly, by
              applying this method to published data, we are able to identify
              previously undocumented relationships using individuals that had
              been excluded from prior kinship analysis due to their very low
              coverage. This methodological improvement has the potential to
              enable relatedness estimation on ancient whole genome shotgun
              data during routine low-coverage screening, and therefore improve
              project management when decisions need to be made on which
              individuals are to be further sequenced.",

              insights into social structures of ancient and historic cultures.
              Most archaeogenetic research concerning kinship has been
              restricted to uniparental markers, while studies using
              genome-wide information were mainly focused on comparisons

              relationship based on modern-day DNA information typically
              require diploid genotype data. Low concentration of endogenous
              DNA, fragmentation and other post-mortem damage to ancient DNA

	abstract = {Robust and reliable estimates of how individuals are biologically related to each other are a key source of information when reconstructing pedigrees. In combination with contextual data, reconstructed pedigrees can be used to infer possible kinship practices in prehistoric populations. However, standard methods to estimate biological relatedness from genome sequence data cannot be applied to low coverage sequence data, such as are common in ancient DNA (aDNA) studies. Critically, a statistically robust method for assessing and quantifying the confidence of a classification of a specific degree of relatedness for a pair of individuals, using low coverage genome data, is lacking.In this paper we present the R-package BREADR (Biological RElatedness from Ancient DNA in R), which leverages the so-called pairwise mismatch rate, calculated on optimally-thinned genome-wide pseudo-haploid sequence data, to estimate genetic relatedness up to the second degree, assuming an underlying binomial distribution. BREADR also returns a posterior probability for each degree of relatedness, from identical twins/same individual, first-degree, second-degree or {\textquotedblleft}unrelated{\textquotedblright} pairs, allowing researchers to quantify and report the uncertainty, even for particularly low-coverage data. We show that this method accurately recovers degrees of relatedness for sequence data with coverage as low as 0.04X using simulated data, and then compare the performance of BREADR on empirical data from Bronze Age Iberian human sequence data. The BREADR package is designed for pseudo-haploid genotype data, common in aDNA studies.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},
